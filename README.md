# Capstone
This repository contains the code from the front end and back end of my Senior Capstone project.
Our project was to create a plant growth pod with an accompanying mobile app to monitor the plant over time.
The front end is a mobile application written in React Native.
The back end is the code we placed in an AWS Lambda function.

All code was originally uploaded to BitBucket, then copied to this repository when the project was completed.
